## Purpose {#purpose}

The purpose of this course is to prepare you to compete in ICPC-style competitive programming contests.  While this will help
you compete in the Illinois Programming League, Hacker Rank, Code Forces, or similar contests, learning this material has been shown
to help with programming assignments in other courses, and many students learn this material to become confident and skillful in coding
interviews.


## Objectives and Outcomes {#objectives-and-outcomes}

Upon successfully completing this course, you will have solved over 100 programming problems.  You will have learned to
select the correct algorithm depending on the problem constraints and available time and memory resources.  You will
have learned to implement your solutions quickly and accurately, being given minimal guidance if your solution is
incorrect.  You will have learned to work on your own and in an ICPC style team of students using one computer.  And
hopefully you will have a lot of fun doing so!


## Class Structure {#class-structure}

In the beginning of each class period there will be a mini-lecture about the algorithm of the day.  After about 20 minutes,
a daily contest will be opened for you to try the algorithms we discussed.  You are supposed to use the class time to solve
problems and to help your classmates (or get help from your classmates) to solve these problems.

Once in a while will also release a larger set of problems that require a variety of approaches so you have practice
picking the correct algorithm to use.

## Assignments and Grading {#assignments-and-grading}

**This course is a Credit/No Credit course.**

There are two components to your grade: attendance and solving problems.

### Attendance {#attendance}

Attendance is required, and will be taken.  You must have attended (or have been excused from) 70% of the available lectures to pass this class.

### Solving Problems {#solving-problems}

We will calculate the percentage of the problems you solve from the pre-class problems, the homeworks, and the bi-weekly
problem sets.  Each problem has the same weight.  To pass the class you must solve 70% of the available problems.
Because we add new problems all the time we cannot tell you ahead of time how many problems will be in the class.

### Improper Optimization

Every semester, somebody fails this course because they tried to do precisely the amount of work necessary and not
one bit more to get the points they need to pass this class... and are off by one.

## Other Things {#other-things}

### Students with Disabilities {#students-with-disabilities}

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the
course instructor as soon as possible. To insure that disability-related concerns are properly addressed from the
beginning, students with disabilities who require assistance to participate in this class should contact disability
resources and educational services ([DRES](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/)) and see the instructor as soon as possible. If you need accommodations for any
sort of disability, please speak to me after class, or make an appointment to see me, or see me during my office hours.
DRES provides students with academic accommodations, access, and support services. To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S.
Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603 (v/tdd), or e-mail a message to [disability@uiuc.edu](mailto:disability@uiuc.edu).


## Emergency Response Recommendations {#emergency-response-recommendations}

The university police have posted some [emergency response recommendations](http://police.illinois.edu/emergency/). I encourage you to review this website and
the campus building [floor plans website](http://police.illinois.edu/emergency-preparedness/building-emergency-action-plans/) within the first 10 days of class.

By the way, have you considered making a fire safety plan with your family or roommates?


## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) {#family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act--ferpa}

Any student who has suppressed their directory information pursuant to family educational rights and privacy act (FERPA)
should self-identify to the instructor to ensure protection of the privacy of their attendance in this course. see the
[FERPA](http://registrar.illinois.edu/ferpa) site for more information.


## Mental Health {#mental-health}

Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes, excessive worry, substance/alcohol abuse, or
problems with eating and/or sleeping can interfere with optimal academic performance, social development, and emotional
wellbeing. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services including individual and group
counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric services, and specialized screenings at no additional cost. If you or
someone you know experiences any of the above mental health concerns, it is strongly encouraged to contact or visit any
of the University's resources provided below.  Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do -- for yourself and
for those who care about you.
